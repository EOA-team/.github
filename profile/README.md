# Earth Observation of Agroecology (EOA)

We, the Earth Observation of Agroecosystems (EOA) team at Agroscope, contribute to improving the sustainability of our land management practices by providing necessary information for targeted decision making.

We use Earth Observation (EO) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and develop empirical and mechanistic models to interpreted EO data from multiple sources across several scales in order to understand the ecophysiological processes happening in our agroecosystems.
